🤯 Saw this image of Fortnite characters like Superman and Batman hanging out in a suburban neighborhood, and it reminded me of the time I had to navigate a "battle royale" of my own - working remotely as a software developer! 🌐💻

I mean, can you imagine Batman trying to meet a project deadline from a coffee shop? 🤣 Or Superman dealing with a weak internet connection? 🚀 It's not easy, folks! But seriously, looking at this image got me thinking about the challenges of remote work. I've been there, done that, and got the t-shirt (which, btw, is probably a Fortnite-themed one 🎮).
