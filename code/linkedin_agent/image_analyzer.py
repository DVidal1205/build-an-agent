SUGGESTED LINKEDIN ANGLES:
- Create content about overcoming technical obstacles
- Share a story about persistence and problem-solving  
- Discuss how setbacks can lead to insights
- Make this a "behind the scenes" authentic moment
- Turn this into a lesson about embracing imperfection

CONTENT DIRECTION: Create an engaging LinkedIn post that acknowledges the technical issue but turns it into a motivational story about persistence, authenticity, or learning from unexpected challenges. Make it feel genuine and relatable while incorporating typical LinkedIn "slop" elements.
